A spinal deformity called scoliosis is typically detected in adolescence and is typified by an abnormal lateral curving of the spine. Serious health problems, such as chronic pain and decreased physical function, can result from scoliosis if treatment is neglected. An automated, effective method is required for scoliosis assessment because traditional human procedures, including calculating the Cobb angle from X-ray scans, are laborious and prone to substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. By using deep learning to simplify convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated Cobb angle measurement, this study offers a method for determining the severity of scoliosis.
Deep learning models—like CNNs—perform exceptionally well in medical imaging because they can automatically pick up intricate patterns and features, which greatly increases the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis. The goal of the research is to keep high accuracy and dependability while simplifying CNN algorithms. In order to identify important vertebral landmarks, the methodology makes use of an organized dataset of annotated X-ray images together with sophisticated data preprocessing, augmentation, and condensed CNN architectures. To improve the annotation process, VGG Image Annotator (VIA) was used. It addressed classification difficulties by offering accurate landmark identification, which is essential for training models.
The outcomes demonstrate that the refined CNN model efficiently and with low computational overhead automates the measurement of Cobb angles, rendering it a useful and dependable instrument for use in scoliosis assessment in clinical settings. Simplified feature extraction techniques enable the suggested CNN model to exhibit strong performance while achieving significant reductions in computational demands and raising diagnostic consistency. It is evident from the results that the CNN model that has been tuned can measure Cobb angles automatically with no computational overhead. This makes it a useful and dependable tool for scoliosis assessment in clinical settings.
